# Clustering Saves - KMeans Parameter Analysis
This repository was created to store and preserve my code for future reference, specifically focusing on the clustering analysis using the KMeans algorithm. The primary objective is to document and archive well-tuned parameter configurations and methodology that have yielded effective clustering results in past analyses.

## Purpose
The code saved here serves as a resource for:

Reviewing parameter choices in KMeans models.
Refining and improving future clustering implementations based on previous successful models.
Streamlining future experiments by referencing the saved scripts, especially when working on similar datasets or clustering problems.
## Key Features
KMeans Algorithm: The code in this repository focuses on applying KMeans clustering, a widely used unsupervised learning technique, to segment data into meaningful groups.

### Parameter Tuning:
Special attention is given to parameter tuning, including choosing the optimal number of clusters (n_clusters) based on metrics such as the silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin score. This ensures that the clusters formed are well-separated and internally coherent.

### Future Analysis: By saving these scripts, I aim to facilitate easy access to well-documented examples of clustering models that can be reused or adapted for similar datasets and tasks.

## Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language used for implementing the models.
Scikit-learn: Used for clustering (KMeans) and evaluation metrics.
Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and analysis of cluster quality.
## Future Improvements:
As I continue working with clustering and explore new datasets, I will update this repository with additional parameter configurations and techniques that improve clustering performance.
